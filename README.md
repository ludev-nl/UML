## TODO
### Setup
---
* First files
  * README.md
  * LICENSE.md
  * RELEASE.md
  * CHANGELOG.md
  * CODING_STANDARDS.md
---
* Scrum process wiki
  * Wiki for sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retrospective
  * Initial Definition of Done in a seperate wiki
  * Initial Definition of Ready (INVEST) in a seperate wiki
---
* Establish testing practices
* Establish git workflow (when and how to branch and merge)
  * Suggestion: merges to 'main' are demoable releases. 'development' has all the latest features from current sprint. New feature-branches branched from development merge back to development to integrate new features during sprint. Development, after sufficient testing at the end of sprint, merges back into master for demoable releases.
