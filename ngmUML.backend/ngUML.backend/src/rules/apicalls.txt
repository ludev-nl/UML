README:
We probably need to setup a Postman API workspace, that is easier than this, but for now this is where we can save API calls.
But we need to setup a Postman API workspace as soon as possible.

Example:
3: Title
Type:       GET/POST
Address:    /rules/
Fields:     {}
Returns:    None

Hoe je makkelijk API calls kan testen:
Option 1: Use Postman Agent (Desktop application of Postman)
Option 2: Use your own Python script (Also useful if you repeatedly need to make several API calls to test)
Option 3: You could also just use your browser, but this gets tedious.

Additional information: POST calls are used to post information to the API, this information is provided in the body of the POST request (form-data in Postman)

=======================================
